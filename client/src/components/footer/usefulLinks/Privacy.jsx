             <p>You agree and accept that your Information may be stored in third-party cloud service infrastructure 
                providers. While all reasonable attempts have been taken from our end to ensure the safe and secure storage

                 security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems. However, as effective as these measures

                 You accept the inherent security implications of data transmission over the internet and the internet
